# Taskhive Workflow

## Planning

In the planning stage, new features or components of the software are considered holistically. A strategy for their design, development and implementation is devised. Planning takes a broad view, where different facets and aspects of the new feature or component are discussed as a whole.

## Design

Once planned, the task of designing the new feature or component is given to a designer or number of designers. When the design is complete it can be approved and referred to developers.

## Development

When the design is complete, development of the new feature or component is distributed among a number of developers. When complete, the individual parts are brought together ready to be tested.

## Testing and auditing

After development is deemed complete, the new feature or component is ready for testing and the code is audited. If the new feature or component fails to meet the quality control standards, it is referred back to development. This process is repeated until the new feature or component passes all tests and audits.

## Production

If the new feature or component passes all tests and audits, it is integrated into the existing software and ready for an alpha release.

## Alpha release

Once integrated, the new version of the software, incorporating the new feature or component, is released to the public as an alpha. Any bugs or issues discovered when it is 'released into the wild' can be noted, and the new feature or component is referred for further testing, auditing and possible redevelopment.

## Official release

When all bugs and issues in the alpha release have been satisfactorily dealt with, the new feature or component becomes part of an official update to the software.
