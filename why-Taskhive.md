# Why Taskhive?

## Introduction

The aim of the Taskhive project is to develop a secure decentralised freelance marketplace. Below are set out the weaknesses endemic to existing freelance marketplace services, and how Taskhive will address those.

The fundamental flaw that existing services exhibit is that they are for-profit businesses. While turning a profit is not in itself a problem, the business models utilised can impose unacceptable limitations on the autonomy and participation of individuals. This is antithetical to the notion of a freelance market.

## No fees

Because existing services operate as businesses, they can impose fees and charges on users. These may be negligible or quite substantial, depending on the service in question. By design, Taskhive will not be a business and will have no way of levying fees or charges to use the marketplace. All earnings will go to vendors.

## Payment flexibility

Existing services prescribe payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards or PayPal. There are numerous reasons, some legitimate, for why this is the case, but it reduces the ability of vendors and clients to make their own financial decisions.

Additionally, requiring the use of specific payment methods may have the effect of locking-out certain users from the marketplace. This can happen where the payment method is not universally supported or where regulation makes a particular method impractical for international transactions. Users should be able to choose payment methods that work best for them.

Taskhive will not prescribe payment methods or currencies for its users, except where absolutely necessary for the functioning of the system or particular features a user wishes to utilise.

## Data autonomy

The nature of existing services is that vendors are effectively customers of the service, who pay fees based on work performed in the marketplace.
